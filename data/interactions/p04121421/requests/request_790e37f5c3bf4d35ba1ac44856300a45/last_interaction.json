I'm here to assist you with any questions you might have about the ABB Wizard Easy Programming Tool.\n\nRegarding your question, in this context, the role of the participant (who could be considered the 'customer' in this scenario) is to implement a software solution using the ABB Wizard Easy Programming Tool. This is a block-based programming language designed for ABB's collaborative robots. The participant will be using this tool to program the ABB CRB 15000 robot (also known as ABB GoFa) equipped with an OnRobot smart gripper.\n\nThe participant's tasks will involve using the programming tool to create a sequence of actions for the robot to perform, such as picking up and placing objects. The participant will interact with the programming language and the FlexPendant (the teaching pendant of the robot), but they should not physically interact with the robot itself.\n\nThe participant should focus on using the ABB Wizard Easy Programming Tool and should not use other services, features, or applications in the robot operating system. They should also not manually teach robot positions, change robot settings, or write, read, or modify RAPID code. The necessary positions for the robot will be given in advance for this experiment.\n\nIf the participant encounters a problem that cannot be solved with the programming language, they should request clarification from the proctor of the experiment. If they have any questions about the programming language or the experiment, they can ask me for assistance.", "timestamp": "12/04/2024 14:48:23"}]}, "created_at": "12/04/2024 14:48:07", "closed_at": "12/04/2024 14:48:58"}
