I'm here to assist you with your robot programming task.\n\nWhen you're using the \"Ask <question> with a numeric answer. Save the answer in <numeric variable>\" block, you need to select a numeric variable where the answer to your question will be stored. If you haven't created a numeric variable yet, you can do so by going to the \"Variable\" category and selecting the \"Number\" option. \n\nOnce you've created a numeric variable, you can select it in the \"Save answer in ____\" field of the \"Ask <question> with a numeric answer\" block. This will store the user's answer to your question in the numeric variable you've selected, and you can use this variable later in your program.\n\nRemember to click the \"Apply\" button at the top center of the programming environment to save your changes every time you make an update in your program solution. \n\nLet me know if you need further assistance!", "timestamp": "15/04/2024 17:14:40"}, {"user_type": "participant", "text": "Im not sure where to attach the number variable to", "timestamp": "15/04/2024 17:16:50"}, {"user_type": "bot", "text": "Sure, I can help with that. In the ABB Wizard Easy Programming Tool, you can attach a number variable to several blocks depending on the context of your program. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. In the \"Move\" category, you can attach a number variable to the \"Move <tool> <speed> to <somewhere>\" block. The number variable can be used to define the speed of the robot's movement.\n\n2. In the \"Stop & Wait\" category, you can attach a number variable to the \"Wait <number> seconds\" block. The number variable will define how many seconds the robot should wait.\n\n3. In the \"Loops\" category, you can attach a number variable to the \"Repeat <number> times\" block. The number variable will define how many times the loop should be executed.\n\n4. In the \"Variable\" category, you can attach a number variable to the \"Set <variable> to\" block. The number variable will define the new value of the variable.\n\nRemember to use the \"Data\" button on the top-right corner of the programming language to set or update your number variable before using it in your blocks.

If you want to check this variable in your \"If, Do\" block, you should insert \"SDR_PRODID\" into the blank space.
