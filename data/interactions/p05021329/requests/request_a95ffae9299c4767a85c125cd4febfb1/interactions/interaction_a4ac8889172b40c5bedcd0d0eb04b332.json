This error usually occurs when the robot is trying to execute a command that involves the gripper, but the gripper is not responding. \n\nIn the ABB Wizard Easy Programming Tool, there are custom blocks under the Procedures category to control the gripper, such as OpenGripper, CloseGripper, and RestartGripper. If you're facing an issue with the gripper, you can try to use the RestartGripper block to reset the gripper and see if it solves the problem. \n\nRemember to click the Apply button at the top center of the programming environment to save your changes before running the program again. \n\nIf the problem persists, I recommend you to request clarification from the proctor of the experiment, as this might be a hardware issue that can't be solved with the programming language. \n\nI hope this helps! If you have any other questions or if you need further clarification, feel free to ask.", "timestamp": "02/05/2024 14:00:21"}]}, "created_at": "02/05/2024 14:00:05", "closed_at": null}
