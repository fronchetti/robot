I'm here to assist you with your programming task.\n\nRegarding your issue, it seems like you're having trouble with the OnRobot smart gripper, which is referred to as RGX in the error message. This error usually occurs when the gripper is not properly connected or initialized in the program.\n\nIn the ABB Wizard Easy Programming Tool, we have custom blocks under the Procedures category to control the gripper. Before you can use the gripper, you need to initialize it using the RestartGripper procedure. This procedure should be placed at the beginning of your program to ensure the gripper is ready for use.\n\nIf you've already done this and the error persists, it might be a technical issue that can't be solved with the programming language. In this case, I recommend you to request clarification from the proctor of the experiment.\n\nI hope this helps! If you have any other questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.", "timestamp": "02/05/2024 14:05:58"}]}, "created_at": "02/05/2024 14:05:46", "closed_at": "02/05/2024 14:17:48"}
