Save this answer in <numeric variable>\" block from the Message category. You can set the <question> to be something like \"Which position should the robot move to?\" and the <answer options> to be the two positions you want the customer to choose from. The answer will be saved in a numeric variable that you define.\n\nThen, you can use the \"If <condition> do\" block from the Logic category to check the value of the numeric variable. If the value is equal to the first option, you can use the \"Move <tool> <speed> to <somewhere>\" block from the Move category to move the robot to the first position. You can do the same for the second option.\n\nRemember to use the Apply button to save your changes every time you make an update in your program solution. \n\nI hope this helps!

Save this answer in <numeric variable>\" block from the Message category to give the customer 4 options of movement. This block will save the option selected by the customer in a numeric variable.\n\nThen, you can use the \"If <condition> do\" block from the Logic category to correspond the options selected by the customer with robot movements. For example, if the numeric variable is 1, you can make the robot move to a specific position. If the numeric variable is 2, you can make the robot move to another position, and so on.\n\nHere is an example of how you can do this:\n\n1. Use the \"Ask 'Which movement do you want to perform?' with '1. Move to position A, 2. Move to position B, 3. Move to position C, 4. Move to position D. Save this answer in 'selectedMovement'\" block.\n\n2. Use the \"If 'selectedMovement' equals 1 do\" block and inside this block, use the \"Move <tool> <speed> to <position A>\" block.\n\n3. Use another \"If 'selectedMovement' equals 2 do\" block and inside this block, use the \"Move <tool> <speed> to <position B>\" block.\n\n4.

Save this answer in <numeric variable>\" block from the Message category to ask the user for input.

The condition in these blocks should compare the numeric variable (where the user's response was saved) with the possible answer options.\n\nFor example, if the user's response was 1, you can make the robot move from bottom left to top left. If the response was 2, you can make the robot move from bottom left to top right, and so on. \n\nThe movement can be performed using the \"Move <tool> <speed> to <somewhere>\" or \"Move <tool> <speed> in a straight line to <somewhere>\" blocks from the Move category.

Save this answer in <numeric variable>\" block into your program.\n\n2. Replace the <question> placeholder with the question you want to ask.\n\n3. Replace the <answer options> placeholder with the options you want to give. The options should be separated by commas. For example, if your options are \"Yes\" and \"No\", you should write \"Yes,No\".\n\n4. Replace the <numeric variable> placeholder with the variable where you want to store the answer. This variable should be a numeric variable. If you haven't created a numeric variable yet, you can do so by going to the Data interface and creating a new numeric variable.\n\nOnce you've set up the block, the programming tool will automatically associate each option with a numeric value.
