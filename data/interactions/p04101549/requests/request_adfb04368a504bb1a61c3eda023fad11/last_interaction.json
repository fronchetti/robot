I'm here to assist you with your robot programming task.\n\nThe RestartGripper procedure is a custom function in the ABB Wizard Easy Programming Tool. It's designed to restart the OnRobot smart gripper, which is the end-effector of the ABB CRB 15000 robot you're working with. This procedure is typically used if an error occurs with the gripper. By calling this procedure, you can reset the gripper to its initial state and continue with the program execution. Please remember to use the \"Call <procedure>\" block under the Procedures category to call this function in your program.", "timestamp": "10/04/2024 16:44:10"}, {"user_type": "participant", "text": "for some reason while executing my code the robot was picking up a can and got stuck and now I can not figure out how to get it to the main position", "timestamp": "10/04/2024 16:44:54"}, {"user_type": "bot", "text": "Sure, I can help you with that. It seems like the robot got stuck during the execution of your program. To resolve this, you can use the \"Stop\" block from the \"Stop & Wait\" category in the ABB Wizard Easy Programming Tool. This block will stop the robot's current action.\n\nAfter stopping the robot, you can use the \"Move\" block from the \"Move\" category to move the robot back to the main position. Remember to select the correct tool, speed, and position in the \"Move\" block. The position should be one of the pre-defined main positions given for this experiment.\n\nRemember to click the \"Apply\" button at the top center of the programming environment to save your changes. After that, you can use the hard buttons on the FlexPendant to start the program again.\n\nIf the problem persists, please ask the proctor of the experiment for further assistance.", "timestamp": "10/04/2024 16:45:04"}, {"user_type": "participant", "text": "ok thank you", "timestamp": "10/04/2024 16:45:56"}, {"user_type": "bot", "text": "You're welcome!
