I'm here to assist you with your robot programming task.\n\nI'm sorry to hear that the CloseGripper procedure isn't working. This could be due to a few reasons. Let's try to troubleshoot it.\n\nFirst, ensure that the CloseGripper procedure is being called correctly in your program. It should be used as a block under the Procedures category, like this: \"Call CloseGripper\".\n\nSecond, check if there are any error messages being displayed on the FlexPendant. If there are, they might give us a clue about what's going wrong.\n\nIf the CloseGripper procedure is being called correctly and there are no error messages, it's possible that there's an issue with the OnRobot smart gripper itself. However, since you're not supposed to physically interact with the robot during this experiment, I would recommend you to request clarification from the proctor of the experiment.\n\nRemember to always hit the Apply button after making changes to your program to ensure they are saved. \n\nIf you have any other questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.", "timestamp": "10/04/2024 16:31:36"}, {"user_type": "participant", "text": "Hello i am trying to close the gripper and for some reason it will not close", "timestamp": "10/04/2024 16:31:43"}, {"user_type": "bot", "text": "Hello, I'm Isaac.
