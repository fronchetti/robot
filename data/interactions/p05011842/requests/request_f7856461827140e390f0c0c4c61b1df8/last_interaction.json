If the dispenser isn't there, you can use the Logic block to instruct the robot to move in a different direction. \n\nThe Logic block can be used to create conditional statements in your program. For example, you can use it to check if a dispenser is present or not. If the dispenser is not present (which can be represented as a boolean value of 'false'), the robot can be instructed to move in a different direction.\n\nBoolean values are a type of data that can only be true or false. In your case, you can use a boolean variable to represent whether a dispenser is present or not. If the dispenser is present, the boolean value would be 'true'. If the dispenser is not present, the boolean value would be 'false'.\n\nOnce all the dispensers have been taken care of, you can use the Stop block from the Stop & Wait category to stop the robot.\n\nRemember to use the Apply button to save your changes every time you make an update in your program solution.

You would need to specify the tool, speed, and the original position as inputs to the block. \n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Drag and drop the \"Move <tool> <speed> to <somewhere>\" block from the Move category into your program.\n2. For the <tool> input, select the tool that the robot is currently using. In this experiment, it should be the OnRobot smart gripper.\n3. For the <speed> input, select the speed at which you want the robot to move. In this experiment, you should not change the speed block.\n4. For the <somewhere> input, select the original position of the robot. The original position should be one of the pre-defined robot positions available in the experiment.\n\nRemember to click the \"Apply\" button at the top center of the programming environment to save your changes. \n\nPlease note that you should not physically interact with the robot or manually teach the robot positions.
