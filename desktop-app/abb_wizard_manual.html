    The default duration is 10s.
    When force control is enabled, the actual robot movement speed depends on all of the defined force, moving distance and spe- cified moving duration.
    If the duration is set to an extremely small value, the robot stops when the duration elapses, no matter it reaches the desired final position or not.
    If the duration is set to an extremely large value, the robot may reach the de- sired final position earlier than the defined duration to ensure the defined force could be achieved.
    In this case, always take the force and distance into consideration when setting the duration.</p></td></tr><tr><td colSpan=1>SearchDuration</td><td colSpan=1><p>Defines the searching duration from the starting position to the position of the object to be pushed/pulled when the robot pushes or pulls an object.</p></td></tr></table><p>When force control is enabled, the actual robot movement speed depends on all of the defined force, moving distance and specified moving duration.
