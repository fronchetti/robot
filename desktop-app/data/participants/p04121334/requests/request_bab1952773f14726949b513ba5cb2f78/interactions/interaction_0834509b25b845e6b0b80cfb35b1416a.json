I'm here to assist you with your robot programming task.\n\nTo move the robot using the ABB Wizard Easy Programming Tool, you can use the blocks under the \"Move\" category. There are two types of movement blocks: \"Move <tool> <speed> to <somewhere>\" and \"Move <tool> <speed> in a straight line to <somewhere>\". \n\nIn your case, you can use the \"Move\" block. You will need to specify the tool (which should be the OnRobot smart gripper), the speed of the movement, and the position to which the robot should move. The positions are predefined and you can select one from the available options.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the block:\n\nMove OnRobot smart gripper SpeedFast to Position1\n\nRemember to click the \"Apply\" button at the top center of the programming environment to save your changes. Once you've done this, you can use the buttons on the FlexPendant to start the program and move the robot.\n\nPlease let me know if you need further assistance.", "timestamp": "12/04/2024 14:19:11"}]}, "created_at": "12/04/2024 14:18:57", "closed_at": "12/04/2024 14:19:42"}
