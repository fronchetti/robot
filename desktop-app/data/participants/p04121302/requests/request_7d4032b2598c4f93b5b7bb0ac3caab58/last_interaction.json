I'm here to assist you with your robot programming task.\n\nTo save responses to a question to a variable, you can use the block \"Ask <question> with <answer options>. Save this answer in <numeric variable>\" or \"Ask <question> with a numeric answer. Save the answer in <numeric variable>\". These blocks are under the Message category. \n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Drag and drop the \"Ask <question> with <answer options>. Save this answer in <numeric variable>\" block into your workspace.\n2. Replace <question> with the question you want to ask.\n3. Replace <answer options> with the options you want to provide.\n4. Replace <numeric variable> with the variable you want to store the answer in. You can create a new variable by clicking on the Data button on the top-right corner of the programming language and then clicking on the Add button under the Variables section.\n\nAfter you have stored the answer in a variable, you can use it in an if statement like this:\n\n1. Drag and drop the \"If <condition> do\" or \"If <condition> do, else\" block from the Logic category into your workspace.\n2. Replace <condition> with the condition you want to check. You can use the \"<variable> <operand> <variable>\" block from the Logic category to create a condition. Replace the first <variable> with the variable you stored the answer in, <operand> with the comparison operator you want to use (like equals, greater than, less than, etc.), and the second <variable> with the value you want to compare the answer with.\n3. Inside the \"If <condition> do\" or \"If <condition> do, else\" block, add the blocks that you want to execute if the condition is true.\n\nRemember to click the Apply button on the top center of the programming environment to save your changes every time you make an update in your program solution. \n\nLet me know if you need further assistance!", "timestamp": "12/04/2024 13:35:55"}]}, "created_at": "12/04/2024 13:35:35", "closed_at": null}
