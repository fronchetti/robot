The ABB Wizard Easy Programming Tool is designed to be used on the FlexPendant, which is a handheld device, not a computer. You don't need a mouse to interact with it. You can navigate through the programming environment using the touchscreen and the hard buttons available on the FlexPendant. For example, you can select blocks by tapping on them, and you can drag and drop blocks to arrange your program. The hard buttons can be used to run and stop the program, move to the next instruction, or return to the previous instruction.
