I'm here to assist you with your robot programming task.\n\nRegarding your issue with the gripper not opening, it could be due to a few reasons. First, ensure that you have correctly used the OpenGripper procedure in your program. This procedure is found under the Procedures category and should be used when you want the gripper to open.\n\nIf you have already used the OpenGripper procedure and the gripper is still not opening, it might be due to an error with the gripper. In this case, you can use the RestartGripper procedure, also found under the Procedures category. This procedure is designed to restart the gripper if an error occurs.\n\nRemember to click the Apply button at the top center of the programming environment to save your changes every time you make an update in your program solution.\n\nIf you've followed these steps and the gripper is still not opening, please request clarification from the proctor of the experiment. They may be able to provide further assistance.", "timestamp": "17/04/2024 15:52:15"}]}, "created_at": "17/04/2024 15:52:04", "closed_at": "17/04/2024 16:15:21"}
