There are two types of move blocks: \"Move <tool> <speed> to <somewhere>\" and \"Move <tool> <speed> in a straight line to <somewhere>\". \n\nTo use these blocks, you need to drag and drop them into your program. Then, you can select the tool, speed, and position for the robot to move to. In this experiment, the tool and speed shouldn't be changed, and the position must be selected according to the pre-defined robot positions available.\n\nPlease remember that you should not physically interact with the robot or manually teach robot positions.

Start by asking the user which dispenser they want to sort the cans into. Use the \"Ask <question> with <answer options>. Save this answer in <numeric variable>\" block from the Message category. For example, you could ask \"Which dispenser do you want to sort the cans into?\" with answer options \"1\" and \"2\". Save this answer in a numeric variable, let's call it \"selectedDispenser\".\n\n2. Now, you need to pick up the cans. Use the \"Pick up next <object> from <location> using VacuumX\" block from the Objects in a tray category. Replace <object> with \"can\" and <location> with the location of the cans.\n\n3. After picking up the can, you need to place it in the selected dispenser. Use the \"If <condition> do\" block from the Logic category to check which dispenser was selected by the user. The condition should be \"selectedDispenser equals 1\" or \"selectedDispenser equals 2\".\n\n4. Inside the \"If <condition> do\" block, use the \"Place item at <location> using VacuumX\" block from the Single object category to place the can in the selected dispenser. Replace <location> with the location of the selected dispenser.\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all cans are sorted. Use the \"Repeat <while or until> <condition>\" block from the Loops category to repeat these steps.

Save this answer in <numeric variable>\" block from the Message category to ask the user which dispenser they want to sort the can to.

If \"dispenserChoice\" equals 2, then the robot should move to Dispenser 2.\n\n3. Inside the \"If <condition> do\" block, use the \"Move <tool> <speed> to <somewhere>\" block from the Move category to move the robot to the chosen dispenser.
