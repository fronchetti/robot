Let's break down the task into smaller steps. \n\nFirst, you need to program the robot to move to the desired position where the sensor pin is properly inserted into the hole. In the block-based programming interface, you can use the \"Move\" block to specify this position. \n\nNext, you need to set a starting position for the search. This can be done using another \"Move\" block. \n\nIf required, you can lock the tool direction. This can be done using the \"Lock Tool Direction\" block. \n\nYou can then name the hole using the \"Set Variable\" block. You can either enter a name yourself or use the default name provided. \n\nNext, you need to set the force used for searching the hole. This can be done using the \"Set Force\" block. \n\nYou can then test the settings using the \"Test Inserting\" block. \n\nFinally, if required, you can set the searching diameter. This can be done using the \"Set Diameter\" block. \n\nRemember, the tool will search towards the hole in a spiral pattern. \n\nI hope this helps! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.", "timestamp": "27/03/2024 08:57:07"}]}, "created_at": "27/03/2024 08:56:47", "closed_at": null}
