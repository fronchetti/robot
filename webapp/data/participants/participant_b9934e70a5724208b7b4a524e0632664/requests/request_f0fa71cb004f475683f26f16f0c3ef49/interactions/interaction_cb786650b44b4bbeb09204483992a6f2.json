There are two types of movement blocks: \"MoveJ\" and \"MoveL\". \n\n\"MoveJ\" moves the robot in a joint motion, meaning the robot moves each joint independently to reach the target position. \n\n\"MoveL\" moves the robot in a straight line from its current position to the target position.\n\nTo use these blocks, you need to drag and drop them into your programming workspace. Each movement block requires three inputs: tool, speed, and position. For this experiment, you should not change the tool and speed. The position must be selected according to the pre-defined robot positions available.\n\nRemember to click the \"Apply\" button at the top center of the programming environment to save your changes every time you update your program.", "timestamp": "27/03/2024 10:19:51"}, {"user_type": "participant", "text": "I am not finding a block called MoveJ \n", "timestamp": "27/03/2024 10:20:28"}, {"user_type": "bot", "text": "In the ABB Wizard Easy Programming Tool, the block to move the robot in joint mode is not specifically called \"MoveJ\".

Here are the steps:\n\n1. Drag and drop a \"Show Message\" block from the Message category. This block will display a message on the teaching pendant screen. You can use this to instruct the user on what to do, for example, \"Press the button to move the can.\"\n\n2. Next, you will need to create buttons for the user to interact with. For this, drag and drop a \"Show Buttons\" block from the Message category. In the \"Show Buttons\" block, you can define the labels for the buttons. For example, you can create two buttons labeled \"Move Can 1\" and \"Move Can 2\".\n\n3. Now, you need to capture the user's input. For this, use the \"Wait for Button Press\" block from the Message category. This block will pause the program until the user presses a button.\n\n4. After the user presses a button, you can use the \"Button Pressed\" block from the Message category to check which button was pressed. You can use this block inside an \"If\" block from the Logic category to create different actions for each button. For example, if the \"Move Can 1\" button was pressed, you can use a \"Move\" block from the Move category to move the robot to the position of Can 1.\n\nRemember to press the Apply button at the top center of the programming environment to save your changes every time you update your program.", "timestamp": "27/03/2024 10:21:18"}, {"user_type": "participant", "text": "How do I create the user interface to move the cans?", "timestamp": "27/03/2024 10:24:04"}, {"user_type": "participant", "text": "", "timestamp": "27/03/2024 10:25:07"}, {"user_type": "bot", "text": "I'm sorry, but your question seems to be a mix of statements and instructions.
