Save this answer in <numeric variable>\" from the Message category, the answer options are encoded as numbers starting from 1. So, if you have 5 options, they will be represented as numbers from 1 to 5. \n\nFor example, if you ask a question with options like \"Red\", \"Blue\", \"Green\", \"Yellow\", \"Black\", and the user selects \"Green\", the number 3 will be stored in the numeric variable because \"Green\" is the third option. \n\nRemember to use the Apply button to save your changes every time you update your program.
