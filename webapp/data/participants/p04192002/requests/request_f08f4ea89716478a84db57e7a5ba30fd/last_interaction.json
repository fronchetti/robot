I'm here to assist you with your programming tasks.\n\nRegarding your issue, it seems like your program is waiting for an input from the user. If you have used a block from the Message category such as \"Ask <question> with <answer options>. Save this answer in <numeric variable>\" or \"Ask <question> with a numeric answer. Save the answer in <numeric variable>\", the program will pause until the user provides an input.\n\nPlease ensure that the user has provided the necessary input on the FlexPendant. If the program is still not progressing, there might be an issue with the way the blocks are arranged in your program. Please review your program and make sure that the blocks are correctly ordered.\n\nIf you're still facing issues, could you please provide more details about your program? That would help me assist you better.", "timestamp": "19/04/2024 21:20:51"}]}, "created_at": "19/04/2024 21:20:35", "closed_at": "19/04/2024 21:22:17"}
