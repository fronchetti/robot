I'm here to assist you with your robot programming task.\n\nTo end the program using user input, you can use the blocks from the Message and Logic categories in the ABB Wizard Easy Programming Tool. Here's a simple way to do it:\n\n1. First, you need to create a numeric variable to store the user input. You can do this by clicking on the Data button on the top-right corner of the programming environment, then clicking on the Add button under the Variables section, and finally setting the variable type to Number.\n\n2. Next, you can use the \"Ask <question> with <answer options>. Save this answer in <numeric variable>\" block from the Message category. This block will ask a question to the user through the FlexPendant and save the answer in the numeric variable you created. For example, you can ask \"Do you want to end the program?\" and set the answer options to \"1 for Yes, 2 for No\".\n\n3. Then, you can use the \"If <condition> do\" block from the Logic category to check the user's answer. If the user's answer is 1 (Yes), you can use the \"Stop\" block from the Stop & Wait category to end the program.\n\nRemember to click the Apply button on the top center of the programming environment to save your changes every time you make an update in your program solution.\n\nI hope this helps! If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.", "timestamp": "12/04/2024 14:44:27"}]}, "created_at": "12/04/2024 14:44:10", "closed_at": "12/04/2024 14:45:15"}
